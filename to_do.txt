Sensor/Back-end:
---------------------

- Fusion Algos
	* Accel only - Done
	* Accel + Gyro - Fri
	* Accel + Gyro + Mag - Sat
Fri - Data processing - from redis to redis
Fri - Metrics calculation

- Monitoring of signal between sensor and desktop
- How to stop after one-shot
- Phone sensor data collection + integrate

- Library of simulated data




---------------------
User Interface:
---------------------

Fri - Data/Metrics:
		* Graphs: accel, gyro, mag data
		* Graphs: calculated metrics over time
		* Tab: Final metrics
- 3D Rendering:
	* All/Individual angles camera view
	* Bat movement:
	Fri -- Bat 3D rotation
		-- Bat angle overlay on ground		
		-- Bat mesh
		-- Vertical plane / bat axis
	* Pause/play at any time
	* Time slider
	* Simulate ball movement
- Visual appeal:
	* Front page
	* Logo
	* Page layout
	* Color scheme
	* Better bat rendering	
- Navigation:
	* Browser screen to select which shots to see
- Comparison:
	* Select two shots
	* Show difference in metrics
	* Show difference - on bat movement
- Historical/Aggregates:
	* Combine all data
	* Show wagon wheel
- Mobile app

DONE: 
* Git repository
* Period change - increase the frequency. 
	- Implement gyro period change function
* Try 'onchange' function instead of period
